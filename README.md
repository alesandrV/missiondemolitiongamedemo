# missiondemolitiongamedemo
"Mission Demolition" or "Angry Birds" like demo game. Made as a study project.

A simple game from "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development" by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

- 3 different "levels", which change one by one.
- Objects` contact recognition and reaction to them (changing level, putting cursor).
- Object spawner (projectile).
- Score calculating system.
- Scene restart and screen changer via the button.
- Simple cloud crafter which adds random-generated clouds on the background.
- Primitive UI with score and button.

Thank you for your time and good luck. :)
